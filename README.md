## SeaHawk II
SeaHawk II is a project designed by a team of community college students from [Cabrillo College](https://www.cabrillo.edu/) based in Aptos, California. SeaHawk II continues Cabrillo Robotics legacy as the team prepares to compete in the 2024 [MATE](https://materovcompetition.org/world-championship) International Competition for the third year in a row. MATE challenges teams worldwide to build a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) that can complete simulated real-world tasks underwater. Teams also demonstrate their robot's functionality and design rationale through marketing, documentation, a presentation, and more. Previously, Cabrillo Robotics has competed in the Pioneer division of the competition and took home first place the last two consecutive years. This year, the team takes on the challenge of developing a ROV to compete in the highest class of the competition: Explore. 

<br>

### ROS2
Much its predecessors, [SeaHawk](https://github.com/CabrilloRoboticsClub/cabrillo_rov_2023) and [Hydrozoa](https://github.com/CabrilloRoboticsClub/cabrillo_rov_2022), SeaHawk II uses The Robot Operating System (ROS). Specifically, SeaHawk uses [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) for its modularity and features useful in developing software specifically for robotics. 

<br>

### Software goals
Cabrillo Robotics has great ambitions improvements and enhancements for software. Goals for the software are to make it user-friendly, easily configurable, and reliable. For ease of use, the software will be have rapid setup on factory hardware, an automatic setup, and safe shutdown. The software should allow the robot to preform photogrammetry (3d model with accurate units), hold its position in the water, and automatically correct for any external forces such as drag and disruptive thrust which cause the robot to drift off course. 

<br>

### Sub-teams
The Cabrillo Robotics software team is divided into sub-teams:  
- üî¥ UX/input
- üü† Hardware integration
- üü° Control systems
- üîµ Management
- üü£ Infrastructure
- ‚ö™Ô∏è Computer vision and AI
